# RMDx8 Python Arduino CAN Bus Project

## Description
This repository appears to involve the integration of Python and C++ for controlling or interfacing with RMDx8 motors using an Arduino CAN bus system. The repository contains at least three main components:
- A Python script: [MotorRMDx8Cansender.py](https://github.com/edgarhernandez94/RMDx8_python_arduinocanbus/blob/main/MotorRMDx8Cansender.py).
- Another Python script with a function: [MotorRMDx8Cansenderfunction5.py](https://github.com/edgarhernandez94/RMDx8_python_arduinocanbus/blob/main/MotorRMDx8Cansenderfunction5.py).
- An executable file, presumably related to motor CAN functions: [motorcanfunction.exe](https://github.com/edgarhernandez94/RMDx8_python_arduinocanbus/blob/main/motorcanfunction.exe).

The specific functionalities and use cases of these components are not detailed in the repository.
